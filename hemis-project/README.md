# Hemis – Second Brain for Your Codebase

This is a starter skeleton for the Hemis project:

- `frontend/`: React + TypeScript UI (to run inside Lauri's webview)
- `backend/`: Common Lisp backend stub (Tree-sitter / RPC hooks go here)

This is NOT a complete app, just a structured starting point you can evolve.
