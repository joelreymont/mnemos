# Hemis TODOs

- [ ] Embedder: real provider via `HEMIS_EMBED_URL`, timeouts, and error-handling tests; document POST/response shape.
- [ ] Snapshots/graph: include edges/symbol metadata in snapshot save/load and surface snapshot status in the UI.
- [ ] Emacs UI: project indexing progress display and a dedicated semantic search buffer with scores/kinds.
- [ ] Startup health: RPC for preload/migration status so the UI can surface readiness.
- [ ] Semantic search test: integration coverage for blending semantic hits when an embedder is configured.
