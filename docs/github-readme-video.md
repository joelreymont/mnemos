# GitHub README Video Embeds

## Summary

GitHub documentation covers video attachments for issues and pull requests, but does not document inline `<video>` support in READMEs. For README demos, use a linked image thumbnail that opens the video file. If you need inline playback, upload the video as an issue/PR attachment and link the generated `user-images` URL.
