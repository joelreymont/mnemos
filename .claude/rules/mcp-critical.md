# MCP CRITICAL - STOP IF BROKEN

**If ANY MCP tool fails or disconnects: STOP ALL WORK IMMEDIATELY.**

1. Read MCP server log
2. Read MCP source, find crash cause
3. Fix the bug
4. Ask user to restart MCP server
5. Only resume work after MCP confirmed working

**NEVER work around broken MCP. NEVER use bash fallbacks. FIX IT FIRST.**
